            The "Recent Months" affects the color highlighting of the monthly report, causing specifically the recent

            The monthly report groups transactions by months and displays a row for each month.
            But the most recent month might have just a few days of transactions, and you probably don't want the report
            to have a row for an incomplete month.
            For example, if you choose 25, then in order for Jan 2023 to be included, there must be a transaction on Jan
            25th 2023 or any time later.

            The various graphs will display the categories ordered by amount (based on the recent average).
            So the highest category will be 1st and colored red, the 2nd highest category will be 2nd & blue, etc.
            If you have many categories and find it overwhelming, you can limit how many different categories can be displayed on the graphs.
            Any category in excess of this limit will be displayed as a subcategory of the "other" category.

            To determine what color a report cell should be, it calculates a cell's "Z-score".
            A z-score is the difference from average, divided by the standard deviation.
            You can think of it as "how far away from the average, in terms of standard deviation units"
            In general, 99.7% of cells will have a z-score between negative 3 and positive 3.

            The report page might have a column with a low standard deviation, and this can cause unimportant changes to
            be a severe color.
            The deadzone reduces the difference from the average before calculating the z-score.
            For example, if a column has an average of $50 and a standard deviation of 4, then a cell with $66 would
            normally be z+4,
            but a deadzone of $5 would treat the cell as if it was just $61 so the z-score is +2.75

            This is similar to the report color deadzone, but instead of completely eliminating the difference, the
            difference within this zone is halved.
            Note that this halving occurs AFTER calculating the report color deadzone.
            For example, a column has an average of $50 & a standard deviation of 4, a deadzone of $5 & the
            half-deadzone of $10, and the cell's amount was $66.
            First the deadzone would reduce the difference from $16 to $11, then the half-deadzone would reduce it from
            $11 to $6, so the z-score is +1.5
